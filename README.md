# Medical Insurance-Price-Prediction
In this Project I am building a model that can predict the price of the premium based on different features that affect the premium, here I am using Regression technique to build the model and for model evaluation I am using R^2 Score.

# START
1. Collected DataSet from Kaggle
2. Performed Data Cleaning on it by identifying any null values and outliers and relaced them using functions(used : average for integers Values and frequency for character type values).
3. Performed Data Visualization using different features to check which feature effects the premium price (used seaborn Regression Plot).

# PRESENT
4. Working on finding the predictor Variable.
